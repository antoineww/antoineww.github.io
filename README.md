# Antoine Wiles Portfolio

As a versatile software engineer, I possess proficiency in multiple programming languages, enabling me to tackle diverse challenges with ease. I am a Jamaican engineer currently living and working remotely in the Caribbean. My past job experience includes collaborating with coworkers stationed in various time zones around the world, such as MST, EST, and CET.

My responsibilities encompass the full software development lifecycle, including building, maintaining, debugging, fixing, refactoring, and deploying applications. I take pride in my ability to deliver high-quality solutions that meet both technical and business requirements.

I've built my personal brand as being a reliable and innovative software engineer. My collaborative nature and strong work ethic make me a great team player, and I am always eager to contribute to the success of projects.
